'''
This module holds the main loop that controls the game flow.
    
Alternates turns between the player and the computer, allowing each to attack the other's grid.
Continues until one player's fleet is completely sunk, declaring the other player the winner.

    This function represents the main game loop for a game of Battleship.

    Parameters:
        player (Player): The human player.
        computer (Computer): The computer player.
        board_player (Board): The game board for the human player.
        board_computer (Board): The game board for the computer player.
        board_computer_players_view (Board): The game board for the computer player 
                                            as viewed by the human player.
        fleet_player (Fleet): The fleet of ships for the human player.
        fleet_computer (Fleet): The fleet of ships for the computer player.
        beginner (Player or Computer): The player who begins the game.

    The function alternates turns between the human player and the computer. On each turn, 
    the current player chooses a coordinate to attack on the opponent's board. The function 
    checks if the attack is a hit or a miss and updates the game boards accordingly. If a 
    ship is hit, the function also updates the status of the ship in the fleet. The game 
    continues until all the ships in a player's fleet have been sunk, at which point the 
    game ends and the other player is declared the winner.
