'''
This module orchestrates the setup and execution of a battleship-style game.
It includes functions for initializing players, grids, fleets, and the game itself,
as well as determining the starting player with a coin flip.

Functions:
    initialize_players: Set up player instances for the game.
    initialize_grids: Prepare the game grids for both players.
    initialize_fleets: Create and populate fleets with ships for both players.
    populate_fleets: Add ships to the players' fleets.
    coin_flip: Randomly decide which player starts the game.
    setup_game: Conduct the complete setup of the game before starting the main loop.
