"""
This module defines the Player class for a battleship game, handling interactions
and decisions for both human and computer players. It includes functionalities
for prompting player names, processing player inputs for ship placement and
attack coordinates, and automating random ship placements for computer players.

Classes:
- Player: Manages ship placements, attack coordinates, and player-specific
  attributes such as name and game state (e.g., hunt mode, last hit, potential targets).
