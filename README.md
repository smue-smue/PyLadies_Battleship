This project is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship game, enhanced with a graphical interface using Pygame.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python (3.x or higher recommended)
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
